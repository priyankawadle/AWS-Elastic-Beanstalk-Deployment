Here’s deployment steps for a Node.js app on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and CodePipeline:

1. **Create an RDS instance**:
   - Launch an Amazon RDS instance (e.g., MySQL/PostgreSQL).
   - Configure the security group to allow inbound traffic from your application.
   - Connect to the RDS instance using a MySQL/SQL workbench or any other database client.
   - Create a database and necessary tables, then insert initial data if required.

2. **Develop Node.js APIs**:
   - Create a Node.js application with RESTful APIs to perform CRUD operations using the RDS database.
   - Ensure the app uses environment variables for database connection credentials (e.g., `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`).

3. **Create an Elastic Beanstalk Application and Environment**:
   - In AWS Elastic Beanstalk, create an application and configure the environment for Node.js.
   - Ensure your Node.js app listens on `process.env.PORT` (default to `8080`) to handle the port correctly.
   - If your app uses a custom port, ensure Elastic Beanstalk is configured to route traffic to the correct port.

4. **Security Group Configuration**:
   - Allow inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic (typically on port 80/443) for the security group associated with the EC2 instances in the Elastic Beanstalk environment.

5. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Add necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection details, API keys) via the Elastic Beanstalk environment settings.

6. **Set up AWS CodePipeline**:
   - Create a CodePipeline in AWS.
   - For the source stage, select your GitHub repository where the Node.js app is hosted.
   - For the build stage (if needed), use AWS CodeBuild or configure the pipeline to skip this step if the app doesn’t require a build process.
   - For the deploy stage, select AWS Elastic Beanstalk as the deployment target.
